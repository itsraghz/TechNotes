## Why should I learn Groovy

* Groovy is an agile and dynamic language
* Seamlessly integration with all existing Java objects and libraries
  * Has a limited support for *Servlet Programming* with _syntactic sugars_
  * Has a good, rich framework for Web Application - *Grails* that promotes the RAD (Rapid Application Development)
* Feels easy and natural to Java developers
* More concise and meaningful code compares to Java
* You can use it as much or as little as you like with Java apps
* Outdated Info: Way back in 2005, Groovy was the first language to offer
  - Feature called `Closures` in Java (now as `Lambda` in Java 8)
  - Groovy had a shell (`groovysh`) which offered *REPL* (Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop (now `JShell` from Java 9 onwards)
