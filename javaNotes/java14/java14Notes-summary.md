# Java 14 Changes

 Java 14 has some interesting of features. Most importantly it has got *Helpful NPE*. 
 

## Helpful NPE 
 
  The Helpful NPE shows the exact object that is set to null,  in a chained call like *a.b.c.d* where if *a.b* is null, it would throw a NPE on the *.c* and the NPE in Java 14 shows the exact object *a.b* that is set to null.

 It also has got 69 new API methods, which will be explored further.
