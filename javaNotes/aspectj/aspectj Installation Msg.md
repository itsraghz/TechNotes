The automatic installation process is complete. We recommend you complete the installation as follows:
Add c:\installedSoft\aspectj1.9\lib\aspectjrt.jar to your CLASSPATH. This small .jar file contains classes required by any program compiled with the ajc compiler.
Modify your PATH to include c:\installedSoft\aspectj1.9\bin. This will make it easier to run ajc and ajbrowser.
These steps are described in more detail in c:\installedSoft\aspectj1.9\README-AspectJ.html.
