# C Programming Notes

## Basics

 * Need of a Computer (which is an extension of a calculator) for the following two main reasons
  * Speed of execution (human can still do but need more time for large set of data)
  * To avoid errors (human can make mistakes - most likely when dealing with large data whereas a Computer will not mostly make any mistakes)

## History

 * C Programming Language was introduced by Dennis Ritchie in the Bell Labs in the  year 1971.
 * It had a good support for the *System Level Programming* due to its support to the kernel resources.
 * It is called as `middle level` language because of its support to both `High Level` and `Low Level` languages.


## Life cycle of a C Program

 * Compilation - Transformation of the source code written in a High level langauge like English to the Low level language which the computer can understand
 * Execution - Running the program by means of its the compiled / intermediate version which the machine (Computer) can understand.
 * The detailed explanation of how a source code written in English like High level language be converted/translated to an intermediate language using a tool like `gcc` is available on the [*samplePgms/basics/HelloWorld.md*] (samplePgms/basics/HelloWorld.md)

## Tools

### Online C Compiler

### Windows - Turbo C

### Linux/Unix - GCC (GNU C Compiler)
