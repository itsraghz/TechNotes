7 30 AM IST - 8 30 AM IST

# Agenda

* Intro to Spring Boot

# SpringBoot

* A Spring based f/w used to reduce the developer efforts by providing pom.xml and configurations
  * Set up  - we get starter elements in the `pom.xml` file for Database/Servers
  * Configurations - Ready Made beans.
* All Spring Concepts exist in Spring Boot with a few additonal elements.
* Ex. Embedded Database/Servers/MicroServices etc., are the newly added

## Benefits

* Starters - are like Parent projects, and developers projects are like Child projects
* Auto Configurations (pre-defined config code)
* Embedded Components (Servers/Databases)
* No XML
