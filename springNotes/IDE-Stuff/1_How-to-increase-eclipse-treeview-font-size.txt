Question: How to increase the font size of the tree view in Project Explorer etc., inside Eclipse / STS IDE.

You can increase the font size via Preferences -> General -> Appearance -> Fonts. However it helps only the content of the files like Java Source, properties file etc.,
In order to increase the font size of the tree structures, you need to alter the settings in a .css file as follows.

Tips: The css folder has so many different stylesheets. You need to know the right theme being used by your STS/Eclipse by clicking on 
     Preferences -> General -> Apperance.

Add the following lines in the .css file - at the end/bottom to override the previous settings if any 
========================================
.MPart Tree {
    font-family: Consolas;
    font-size: 8;
}

Also try to add * { font-size: 12; } if you prefer at the end of all. Modify the size amount as appropriate.
