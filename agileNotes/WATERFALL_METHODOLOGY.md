# Waterfall Methodology

## Traditional Waterfall Approach

Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development where progress flows steadily downwards through phases like a waterfall. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

## Phases

### 1. Requirements
* Gather all possible requirements
* Document everything in detail
* Get client sign-off
* Create requirement specification document

### 2. Design
* System design
* Architecture planning
* Module design
* Database design
* Interface design

### 3. Implementation
* Coding begins
* Unit development
* Following design documents
* Code documentation
* Progress tracking

### 4. Testing
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
* Acceptance testing
* Bug fixing

### 5. Deployment
* Product delivery
* Installation
* User training
* System documentation
* Go-live support

### 6. Maintenance
* Bug fixes
* Feature enhancements
* System updates
* Performance tuning
* Support

## When to Use Waterfall

Waterfall is most suitable for projects where:
* Requirements are clear and fixed
* Technology is well understood
* Project is short
* Quality is more important than speed
* Resources need to be planned in advance

## Real-World Examples

### NASA Space Missions
* Clear requirements from start
* High emphasis on documentation
* Safety-critical systems
* Extensive testing required
* Limited scope for changes

### Construction Projects
* Detailed planning required
* Sequential execution
* Change is expensive
* Clear milestones
* Regulatory compliance

## Benefits

* Clear structure
* Well-documented process
* Easy to understand and manage
* Clear milestones
* Detailed documentation
* Suits regulatory requirements

## Limitations

* Inflexible to changes
* Late testing cycle
* High risk and uncertainty
* Long delivery time
* Customer sees product late
* Limited customer feedback
