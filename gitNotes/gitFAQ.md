# Git FAQ

1. *Q*:  What is the difference between commit -a and commit -m in git?

   *A*: Using the '-a' flag automaticaly adds the tracked files to the staging area (in other words, it performs a `git add` on all files which you already tracked before).  And, the '-m' flag simply lets you apply the commit message.  So, for the first commit on the project, you can't use '-a' flag as no files have been `add`ed yet.
