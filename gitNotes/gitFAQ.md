#TODO for the pending questions.

## What is the difference between commit -a and commit -m in git?

   Using the '-a' flag automaticaly adds the tracked files to the staging area (in other words, it performs a `git add` on all files which you already tracked before).  And, the '-m' flag simply lets you apply the commit message.  So, for the first commit on the project, you can't use '-a' flag as no files have been `add`ed yet.

## Git keeps asking me to enter credentials for everytime I issue `git push` for the repo. How do I stop?

  Have been reading on the Internet for the resolution. They suggest to use either SSH or a different approach. #TBD complete this.
